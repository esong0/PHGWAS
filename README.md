# Persistent homology analysis of GWAS in PPI networks

This computational topology framework computes persistent homology features of GWAS loci in protein–protein interaction (PPI) networks.

Any human PPI network data can be used. For example, please see the human PPI data in Wang & Loscalzo's [paper](https://doi.org/10.1002/psp4.12670) and [STRING](https://string-db.org/).
