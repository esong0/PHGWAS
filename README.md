# Persistent homology analysis of GWAS in PPI networks

This computational topology framework computes persistent homology features of GWAS loci in protein–protein interaction (PPI) networks.

The consolidated human PPI data can be found in Wang & Loscalzo's [paper](https://doi.org/10.1002/psp4.12670).
